# Band Name Generator

## Project Overview

This project is a simple **Band Name Generator**, part of the 100 Days of Python challenge. The program generates a potential band name based on user input.

## How It Works

The user is prompted to enter:
1. The city they grew up in.
2. The name of their pet.

The program then combines these two inputs to suggest a potential band name.

## Example

Welcome to the Band Name Generator. What's the name of the city you grew up in?

Los Angeles 

What's your pet's name? 

Whiskers

Your band name could be Los Angeles Whiskers.


## Lessons Learned

- Basic use of Python `input()` to take user input.
- String concatenation in Python.
